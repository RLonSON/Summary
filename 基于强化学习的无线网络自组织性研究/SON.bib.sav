  abstract  = {We describe a novel wireless backhaul solution, called Self-Optimizing Wireless Mesh Network (SWMN), which is targeted for interconnecting 5G small cell nodes cost-efficiently and smartly. SWMN is not only highly resilient and scalable, but it is also equipped with advanced Self-Organizing Network (SON) capabilities offering autonomous network configuration and traffic engineering features. The key aspect of SWMN is an innovative network intelligence engine coupled with beam steerable pencil beam millimeter wave (mmW) high capacity backhaul radio.},

  title       = {From 4G to 5G: Self-organized Network Management meets Machine Learning},
  abstract    = {In this paper, we provide an analysis of self-organized network management, with an end-to-end perspective of the network. Self-organization as applied to cellular networks is usually referred to Self-organizing Networks (SONs), and it is a key driver for improving Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) activities. SON aims at reducing the cost of installation and management of 4G and future 5G networks, by simplifying operational tasks through the capability to configure, optimize and heal itself. This autonomous management vision has to be extended to the end to end network, to satisfy 5G network management requirements. In literature and also in some instances of products available in the market, Machine Learning (ML) has been identified as the key tool to implement autonomous adaptability and take advantage of experience when making decisions. In this paper we survey how network management can significantly benefit from ML solutions. We review and provide the basic concepts and taxonomy for SON, network management and ML. We analyse the available state of the art in the literature, standardization and in the market. We pay special attention to 3GPP evolution in the area of network management and to the data that can be extracted from 3GPP networks, in order to gain knowledge and experience in how the network is working, and improve network performance in a proactive way. Finally, we go through the main challenges associated with this research line, in both 4G and in what 5G is getting designed, while identifying new directions for research.},

We identify the potential of participatory sensing in enabling the self-organisation, deployment optimisation and radio resource management of wireless cellular networks. We also highlight how this approach can meet the future goals for the next generation of cellular system in terms of infrastructure sharing, management of multiple radio access techniques, flexible usage of spectrum and efficient management of very small data cells.},
